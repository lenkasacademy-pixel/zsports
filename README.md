Client-facing Meta ads reports for **Shah Sports Tech Private Limited** (Z-Bat).

| AI Bat Fit Quiz — Website Leads | from 8 Sep 2026, rolling | [index.html](https://lenkasacademy-pixel.github.io/zsports/) |

Source: Meta Ads API, ad account `1811409506889048` (zbats), plus store pixel
dataset `1380826504029254`. Figures are in the advertiser's time zone, currency INR.

**Status as of 23 Sep 2026: all three quiz campaigns read PAUSED and none has
spent since 21 September.** They also read PAUSED on 20 and 21 September while
spending, so do not assume a PAUSED status means a campaign is finished — always
re-pull the days, and re-pull the days either side of the last snapshot too
(Meta revised both of those days up by ₹0.28 after they were published).
The page works all of this out from `CAMPS` status and the `DAILY` rows and says
it in its own words — do not hand-write a note about it.

**Dream Bat started spending on 23 Sep** and is now the second entry in `OTHER`:
₹1,154.35, 189 landing page views, 27 adds to cart, 13 site leads, no purchases
yet. It sells the bat directly rather than through the quiz, so like the clinic
it is held out of every quiz figure and named in the scope line. The clinic has
also picked up — ₹5,952.18 and **7 purchases**, up from 1 two days ago.

Non-quiz spend on this account is now ₹7,106.53, more than the quiz has ever
spent (₹6,692.70). When the quiz is dark, this report describes a smaller and
smaller share of what the account is doing — worth saying to the client rather
than letting the page look idle.

## Shape

`index.html` is a **single self-contained file**. Figures live in flat arrays in
the `<script>` block at the bottom; everything above them — every table, every
bar, **and every sentence** — is rendered from those arrays at load time. Nothing
calls the network. There is no build step and no separate internal version.

This is the same shape as the Elixir Creative Ledger and the O2 / Halcyon calls
reports, and it is what makes the page safe to refresh automatically: no prose
goes stale when a day is added, because no prose is written by hand.

## Refreshing it

Patch the arrays, nothing else:

| Array | Row shape |
|---|---|
| `DAILY` | `[date, spend, impressions, lpv, cart adds, leads]`, one per day |
| `REELS` | `[creative, spend, impressions, lpv, cart adds, leads, [campaign indexes]]`, sorted by spend desc |
| `PLACE` | `[platform, position, spend, impressions, lpv, leads]` |
| `AGE` | `[band, gender, spend, impressions, lpv, leads]` |
| `PIXEL` | `[date, ...counts in EV order]` — `EV` names the events |
| `SNAP_DAY` | the still-running day; `SNAP_TS` the snapshot stamp |

**The last `DAILY` row must be `SNAP_DAY`.** The page treats that day as still
accruing: it is shown separately, labelled "so far", and excluded from every
headline total and from the blended cost per lead. That is the guard against
Meta's ~48h revisions — a part-day must never set a headline number.

### Checks that must pass before publishing

- `REELS` totals equal `DAILY` totals on spend, impressions **and** leads.
- `AGE` totals equal `DAILY` totals on spend and leads.
- `PLACE` matches `DAILY` exactly on leads; a few rupees of spend drift is
  Meta's own breakdown rounding and is reported on the page (`PLACE_DRIFT`).

### Store pixel

Pull with `ads_get_dataset_stats`, `aggregation: "event"`, unix
`start_time`/`end_time`; max lookback 28 days. Events are stamped **−07:00**, and
an IST day D is the 24 buckets from (D−1) 12:00 through D 11:00. These counts
cover all site traffic, not only visitors from ads, so they run ahead of the Meta
lead count — the page says so.

`ClinicBookOpened`, `ClinicSlotPicked` and `Schedule` began firing on 12 Sep 2026
(the clinic booking flow) and are carried in `PIXEL`; the funnel note mentions
them automatically once they have volume.
