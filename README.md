Client-facing Meta ads reports for **Shah Sports Tech Private Limited** (Z-Bat).

| Report | Period | Live |
|---|---|---|
| Z-Bat — every Meta campaign | from 8 Sep 2026, rolling | [index.html](https://lenkasacademy-pixel.github.io/zsports/) |

Source: Meta Ads API, ad account `1811409506889048` (zbats), plus store pixel
dataset `1380826504029254`. Figures are in the advertiser's time zone, currency INR.

**Status as of 25 Sep 2026: all three quiz campaigns read PAUSED and none has
spent since 21 September** — five refreshes now at exactly ₹6,692.70 and 1,019
leads, with not even a late-attributed lead moving. They also read PAUSED on 20
and 21 September while spending, so do not assume a PAUSED status means a
campaign is finished — always re-pull the days, and re-pull the days either side
of the last snapshot too (Meta revised both of those days up by ₹0.28 after they
were published). The page works all of this out from `CAMPS` status and the
`DAILY` rows and says it in its own words — do not hand-write a note about it.

**The whole account has nearly stopped today.** The Clinic took ₹13.29 on 25 Sep
and Dream Bat ₹2.97 — ₹16.26 between them against ₹1,100/day of budget, with both
campaigns ACTIVE. Halcyon showed the same shape on the same day. Worth watching
rather than acting on yet; a single quiet day is not a billing problem.

**Dream Bat**, the second entry in `OTHER`, is at ₹1,337.01 over three days:
222 landing page views, 36 adds to cart, 14 site leads, **still no purchase**.
That is the quiz funnel's old cart problem appearing again on a campaign that
does not touch the quiz — worth flagging before it spends more. It sells the bat
directly, so like the clinic it is held out of every quiz figure and named in the
scope line. The clinic is at ₹6,377.06 and **8 purchases**.

Non-quiz spend on this account is now ₹7,714.07, more than the quiz has ever
spent (₹6,692.70). When the quiz is dark, this report describes a smaller and
smaller share of what the account is doing — worth saying to the client rather
than letting the page look idle.

## Every campaign is tracked (changed 25 Sep 2026)

The report used to cover the three quiz campaigns only, with the clinic and Dream
Bat reduced to a footnote in an `OTHER` list. **That list is gone.** All six
campaigns on account `1811409506889048` are now first-class: `CAMPS_ALL`,
`DAILY_ALL` (a row per campaign per day) and `ADS_ALL` (a row per ad) drive a new
account section at the top, and every campaign gets its own creative table.

**Leads and purchases are never blended.** The account sells three different
things — quiz leads, ₹199 clinic sessions, and bats — so each group is priced in
its own currency and there is deliberately no single account-wide "cost per
result". `CAMPS_ALL[i][5]` says which result kind a campaign reports.

**Reach is carried, not derived.** `CAMPS_ALL[i][6]` is Meta's own de-duplicated
lifetime reach per campaign. It can never be obtained by adding the day rows up,
so the account table shows it per campaign and leaves the total blank.

The quiz keeps its own sections below the account view, because it is the only
funnel on the account with site events behind it — the placement, age and pixel
breakdowns exist for the quiz and nothing else. Those arrays (`DAILY`, `ADS`,
`PLACE`, `AGE`, `H`) stay quiz-only and are unchanged.

**What the builder asserts before writing the file:** for every campaign, its day
rows and its ad rows must agree on spend, impressions, link clicks, page views,
adds to cart, purchases and leads; and the three quiz campaigns in `DAILY_ALL`
must reconcile against the quiz-only `DAILY` on both spend and leads. Reach is
excluded from these checks on purpose.

## Shape

`index.html` is a **single self-contained file**. Figures live in flat arrays in
the `<script>` block at the bottom; everything above them — every table, every
bar, **and every sentence** — is rendered from those arrays at load time. Nothing
calls the network. There is no build step and no separate internal version.

This is the same shape as the Elixir Creative Ledger and the O2 / Halcyon calls
reports, and it is what makes the page safe to refresh automatically: no prose
goes stale when a day is added, because no prose is written by hand.

## Refreshing it

Patch the arrays, nothing else:

| Array | Row shape |
|---|---|
| `DAILY` | `[date, spend, impressions, lpv, cart adds, leads]`, one per day |
| `REELS` | `[creative, spend, impressions, lpv, cart adds, leads, [campaign indexes]]`, sorted by spend desc |
| `PLACE` | `[platform, position, spend, impressions, lpv, leads]` |
| `AGE` | `[band, gender, spend, impressions, lpv, leads]` |
| `PIXEL` | `[date, ...counts in EV order]` — `EV` names the events |
| `SNAP_DAY` | the still-running day; `SNAP_TS` the snapshot stamp |

**The last `DAILY` row must be `SNAP_DAY`.** The page treats that day as still
accruing: it is shown separately, labelled "so far", and excluded from every
headline total and from the blended cost per lead. That is the guard against
Meta's ~48h revisions — a part-day must never set a headline number.

### Checks that must pass before publishing

- `REELS` totals equal `DAILY` totals on spend, impressions **and** leads.
- `AGE` totals equal `DAILY` totals on spend and leads.
- `PLACE` matches `DAILY` exactly on leads; a few rupees of spend drift is
  Meta's own breakdown rounding and is reported on the page (`PLACE_DRIFT`).

### Store pixel

Pull with `ads_get_dataset_stats`, `aggregation: "event"`, unix
`start_time`/`end_time`; max lookback 28 days. Events are stamped **−07:00**, and
an IST day D is the 24 buckets from (D−1) 12:00 through D 11:00. These counts
cover all site traffic, not only visitors from ads, so they run ahead of the Meta
lead count — the page says so.

`ClinicBookOpened`, `ClinicSlotPicked` and `Schedule` began firing on 12 Sep 2026
(the clinic booking flow) and are carried in `PIXEL`; the funnel note mentions
them automatically once they have volume.
